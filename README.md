# dev-assets
Image sets for my personal use. I leave it as a public repo in case some one needs convenient indexed sets for web-dev, image processing or any other purpose you might have.

### set_1 and set_2 is a clone of The Berkeley Segmentation Dataset

Available to download [here](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/bsds/)

Note: I changed image 117 in set_2
